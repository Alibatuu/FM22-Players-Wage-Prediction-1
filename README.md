## Dataset Information
There are 4 different data in our project.
Two of them are data of FM'22 players and clubs. The other two are data of FM'21 players and clubs. Our main data is the data of FM'22 players.
The target variable may differ from project to project. However, we have estimated the salaries of the players in this project.

### FM'22 Players Dataset
- The dataset has 53 columns and approximately 15k rows. Each row contains information about different players.

### FM'22 Clubs Dataset
- The dataset has 18 columns and approximately 3k rows. Each row contains information about different clubs.

### FM'21 Players Dataset
- The dataset has 53 columns and approximately 15k rows. Each row contains information about different players.

### FM'21 Clubs Dataset
- The dataset has 18 columns and approximately 3k rows. Each row contains information about different clubs.
